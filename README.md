### **Objective**

In this project, I'll conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to research on Music Therapy. The goal is to explore the potential correlations between participants' favorite music genres and their mental health. The aim is to uncover meaningful connections between music preferences and mental health, which can contribute to the effective application of Music Therapy and provide valuable insights into the psychological impact of different music genres.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **1. Most Popular Streaming Services**

Interpretation: Identifies the most widely used streaming platforms. The chart likely shows platforms like Spotify, YouTube, or Apple Music leading in popularity.

Insight: Popular platforms are preferred channels for delivering music therapy playlists or promotional content.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **2. Age Distribution**

Interpretation: Visualizes the distribution of respondent ages. A dominant age group (e.g., 18–24) might emerge.

Insight: Music preferences and mental health metrics can be better understood by targeting the dominant age range.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **3. Hours Per Day Spent Listening**

Interpretation: Shows daily listening habits. Higher listening hours may correlate with specific mental health patterns.

Insight: Identify the group listening the most (e.g., 3–5 hours) to study their preferences and mental health metrics more closely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **4. Listening Music While Working/Studying**

Interpretation: Indicates how many respondents listen to music during productive tasks. Likely segmented into Yes/No responses.

Insight: If "Yes" dominates, it shows music's role in enhancing focus or relaxation while working/studying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **5. Foreign Languages Preference in Music**

Interpretation: Displays the percentage of respondents listening to music in non-native languages.

Insight: A high percentage indicates a preference for diverse and cross-cultural music experiences, which could be leveraged in therapy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **6. BPM of Favorite Genre Breakdown**

Interpretation: Visualizes the beats per minute distribution across genres. Faster genres like EDM or slower genres like Classical might stand out.

Insight: Matching BPM to mental health goals (e.g., calming slower BPM for anxiety or upbeat faster BPM for motivation).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **7. Average Anxiety Levels**

Interpretation: Likely a bar or scatter chart comparing anxiety levels with demographic or listening habits.

Insight: Certain demographics or habits might show higher/lower average anxiety levels, helping tailor music therapy programs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **8. Music Listening Hours vs. Mental Health**

Interpretation: Shows the relationship between hours spent listening and mental health metrics (e.g., Anxiety, Depression).

Insight: Longer listening durations might correlate with improved or worsened mental health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **9. Correlation Between Mental Health Metrics**

Interpretation: A scatter or correlation matrix showing relationships between metrics like Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD.

Insight: Identifies how mental health conditions interrelate, such as Anxiety and Insomnia often occurring together, suggesting specific music interventions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### **Key Insights Across Charts:**

1. Mental Health and Listening Duration:
Longer listening durations might reduce anxiety or enhance focus, but excessive listening could indicate coping mechanisms for stress.

2. Genres and Mental Health:
Faster BPM genres may energize but could increase anxiety, while slower BPM genres might calm listeners.

3. Platform and Diversity Preferences:
Streaming services like Spotify dominate, suggesting where interventions are most impactful. A significant number of respondents enjoy foreign language music, showing its universal appeal.

4. Demographics:
If young adults dominate, interventions could be designed with their preferences (e.g., EDM, Lo-fi) in mind.
